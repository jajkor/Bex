# Overview
Bex (Boolean Expressions) is a high-level, functional programming language designed for modeling and simulating digital logic circuits. Inspired by Lisp-like S-expression syntax, it allows users to define logic gates and circuits nested functional structure using a nested functional structure.
With built-in support for fundamental Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR), Bex enables both beginners and advanced users to explore combinational logic, design gate networks, and reason about Boolean expressions in a clear and structured manner.
